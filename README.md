# Sorting-Comparison
This project collect about 10 kinds of sorting algorithms and compare them in time complexity and show actual excuting time.

Collected sorting algorithms:
1.Bucket Sort
2.Comb Sort
3.Quick Sort (dual pointer)
4.Merge Sort
5.Heap Sort
6.Radix Sort (LSD)
7.Shell Sort
8.Gnome Sort
9.Cocktail Shaker Sort
10.Selection Sort
11.Bubble Sort
12.Insertion Sort

And there's also some sorting in C++ Standard Library:
A.std::sort()
B.std::stable_sort()

Easter Egg:
BOGO Sort (LOL)

This program provide a menu for user to pick the funuction they want, they are able to choose if they want to use the built-in test data or costomize.
Next step, they can add alogrithms wanna be compared into the list. While excuting, program will show the time complexity while whole sorting procedure done.
Programe ends while all algorithms finish their sorting and the final result will be shown in terminal. Users are allowed to go back to menu and pick the other algorithm for next comparing or just exit the progarm easily.
BTW, to activate the easter-egg, perss F12.
